<h3><b><br> Modified England Schwab Test </b></h3>

The Schwab and England ADL (Activities of Daily Living) scale is a method of assessing the capabilities of people suffering from impaired mobility. 
Originally presented at a Parkinson's disease conference, the scale assesses the difficulties patients have completing daily activities or chores.

<br><br>Fill in your score based on the following metrics:

<br><b>100% : Completely independent.</b> Able to do all chores without slowness, difficulty or impairment.
<br><b>90%: Completely independent.</b> Able to do all chores, but with some degree of slowness, difficulty and/or impairment. One might take two times longer than normal to complete chores.
<br><b>80% : Usually completely independent.</b> Takes two times longer than normal to complete chores.
<br><b>70% : Mostly independent.</b> Faces more difficulty with some chores. One spends a large part of the day with chores and might take three to four times longer than normal.
<br><b>60% : Somewhat independent.</b> Can do most chores, but exceedingly slowly and with much effort. Errors are possible during the chores.
<br><b>50% : Mostly dependent.</b> Needs help with half of every chore. Everything is difficult to one.
<br><b>40% : Very dependent.</b> Can assist with chores, and can complete some alone.
<br><b>30% : Very dependent.</b> With help, can start chores. One can also complete few chores with effort and help.
<br><b>20% : Very dependent.</b> Can slightly help with chores, but cannot complete any alone.
<br><b>10% : Fully dependent.</b> Is helpless and somewhat comatose.
<br><b>0% : Fully dependent.</b> Is bedridden and helpless. One is almost completely comatose.
